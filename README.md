# ionic_otrs

**Proof of concept**
An Ionic application to access our internal OTRS application from a mobile device.
Generate a quick ticket by selection the reason + extra comments.

Username and password + URL to the REST interface can be entered in the
Settings menu, and will be saved into Local Storage.

## TODO
* Catch errors (currently no check if correct user data has been
  provided, ...)
* Parametrize Ticket options, Queue, etc ...
* and MUCH MUCH MORE !
